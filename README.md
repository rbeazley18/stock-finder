# stock-finder
  This application is built with just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It allows the user to search any stock ticker and retrieve information from the AlphaVantage API. This project was a great opportunity to learn how to do a significant amount of DOM manipulation with vanilla JS, and how to utilize the JS Fetch API. I also gained experience with map and cleaning up API data such as currency, percentages, and dates/times using functions. This site only uses plain CSS and HTML, which helped solidify my CSS skills by not relying on a framework, such as Bootstrap. Additionally, I added localStorage to the autocomplete search feature to reduce the number of API calls needed when searching a ticker that has been previously searched by the user. Rendering components at the appropriate time with just vanilla JS proved to be a little tedious compared to using something like React, but it was a great learning experience. Creating the dyanamic searchbar with vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML proved to be one of the more difficult tasks, but it was great practice with different tools, such as CSS flexbox, variables, and z-index. The free tier of the API is currently limited to five calls per minute, so if you get a "No Data Found" message, it is worth trying again after about a minute. Also, each letter typed in the searchbar uses an API call until it is stored in localStorage for the user.
